# E-commerce-Website
I build this Website when I was just starting JS so it doesn't have much functionalities 
other than onclicks and some other functions which were very basic at the time.
Even though it's not a really a unique project it still helped to understand JS and how to use Js for my projects.
I also plan to add other functionalites into this which serve a rather usefull purpose other than just onclicks.
