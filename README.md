This is a basic e-commerce website that I built when I was just starting out with JavaScript. At the time, the project mainly focused on understanding core JavaScript concepts such as event handling (onclick), simple functions, and DOM manipulation.

While the project does not include advanced functionality yet, it played an important role in helping me understand how JavaScript integrates with HTML and CSS to add interactivity to real-world projects.

This project serves as a foundation, and I plan to gradually enhance it by adding more meaningful features such as improved user interactions, dynamic content handling, and practical e-commerce functionalities as I continue learning and improving my JavaScript skills.
